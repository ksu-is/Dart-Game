# Project Road Map

I actually found a text-based dart game in Python that I will use as a base for the game and its scoring system. Here is the link:

# How it Works
If you scroll down on the post, you can find a post from totallygeek that allows you to run a dart game in any Python terminal.
It asks you how many players are playing, who is playing, and then randomizes 5 throws for 5 different scores that add to a final total.

# The Best Part
The best part about the code posted by totallygeek is that it can be run in any python 3 terminal.

# Steps
1: Get the initial dart game set up (DONE!)
2: get the scoring system set up (DONE! almost)
3: Get the tournament system set up
4: Link together the dart game and the scoring system
5: Implement the game and the tournament system
6: Game complete
